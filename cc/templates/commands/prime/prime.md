# Prime - General Codebase Understanding

## Purpose
Set up agent with foundational knowledge of the codebase for general development tasks.

## Run Step
Verify we're in project root:
- Check for key files (README.md, package.json/setup.py, etc)
- Confirm working directory

## Read Step

Read these files in order:

1. **README.md** - Project overview and quickstart
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** or **docs/architecture.md** - System design (if exists)
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Development guidelines (if exists)
4. **.claude/CLAUDE.md** - Project-specific conventions
5. **Main entry point** - src/main.py, app.js, etc

## Report Step

Provide concise summary covering:

**Project Understanding**:
- Purpose and main functionality
- Tech stack and key dependencies
- Project structure (main directories)

**Development Context**:
- How to run the project
- How to run tests
- Key conventions (style, patterns)

**Ready For**:
- General development tasks
- Code exploration
- Feature implementation

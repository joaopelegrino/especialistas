## CODE PATTERNS TO PRESERVE
Healthcare GenServer Pattern:
- Always include compliance validation
- Always log for audit trail
- Always handle PHI/PII securely
- Always verify professional credentials

Zero Trust Policy Pattern:
- Continuous verification required
- Healthcare-specific trust scoring
- Compliance rule integration
- Policy enforcement at every access

WASM Plugin Security Pattern:
- Sandbox isolation (no WASI, no network)
- Capability-based security
- Memory and time limits
- Input/output validation

## COMPLIANCE KNOWLEDGE
LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados):
- Art. 11: Sensitive personal data processing
- Consent management requirements
- Data subject rights implementation
- Cross-border transfer restrictions

CFM (Conselho Federal de Medicina):
- Professional registration validation
- Medical algorithm approval process
- Clinical decision support requirements
- Telemedicine compliance rules

ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária):
- Medical software classification
- Clinical validation requirements
- Adverse event reporting
- Quality management system

## TECHNICAL PATTERNS
Healthcare AI Pipeline: S.1.1→S.1.2→S.2-1.2→S.3-2→S.4-1.1-3
- S.1.1: LGPD Analyzer (risk assessment)
- S.1.2: Medical Claims (content extraction)
- S.2-1.2: Scientific Search (evidence gathering)
- S.3-2: SEO Optimizer (CFM compliance)
- S.4-1.1-3: Content Generator (final output)

Host-Plugin Architecture:
- Elixir OTP supervisors for reliability
- WASM plugins for medical processing
- Capability-based security model
- Real-time monitoring and logging

## DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS
Error Handling: Always consider patient safety implications
Testing: Minimum 95% coverage for healthcare-critical code

Performance: Healthcare systems require real-time response
Compliance: Every feature includes LGPD/CFM validation

## COMMON TROUBLESHOOTING CONTEXTS
WASM Memory Issues: Use chunking for large medical content
Zero Trust Conflicts: Healthcare rules override general security
PQC Performance: Hybrid encryption during transition period
LGPD Violations: Implement data minimization and consent validation
FHIR Validation: Cache results for performance, validate structure
Professional Validation: CRM/CRP registry integration required

## KNOWLEDGE VALIDATION RULES
Evidence Requirement: All medical claims must include scientific evidence
Regulatory Currency: Compliance information reviewed monthly
Technical Accuracy: Implementation details validated against source code
Cross-Reference Integrity: All dependencies verified and documented
Performance Verification: Benchmarks updated with actual measurements

## LLM OPTIMIZATION HINTS
Healthcare Implementation: Reference stack score 99.5/100 and justification

## üéØ **Context Engineering Overview**

### **What Is Context Engineering**
Context Engineering √© a nova capability September 2025 que permite otimiza√ß√£o inteligente do uso de tokens atrav√©s do comando `/context`, resultando em 15-25% de efici√™ncia de tokens melhorada.

**Analogia**: "Body-fat scale" para conversa√ß√µes Claude Code - mostra exatamente onde tokens est√£o sendo consumidos e onde podem ser otimizados.

## üìä **`/context` Command**

### **Functionality**
```bash
/context  # Executa an√°lise completa de token usage

# Outputs:
# - Token distribution breakdown

# ðŸ”„ Task Tool Migration Guide - Legacy Commands â†’ Native 2025

## ðŸ“Š Migration Overview

### From Legacy System (2024)
- Custom slash commands (`/start-phase-orchestrator`)
- Manual coordination between agents
- Sequential execution only
- Shared context window

### To Native System (2025)
- Natural language task descriptions
- Automatic Task tool delegation
- Parallel execution (up to 10 concurrent subagents)
- Isolated context windows (200k tokens each)

## ðŸ”„ Command Migration Mapping

### Phase Implementation
```bash
# Legacy (2024):
/start-phase-orchestrator bm-2

# Native (2025):
"Implement Phase BM-2 wizard with comprehensive validation"

# Result: Auto-delegates to:
# - bm-wizard-specialist.md (implementation)
# - test-engineer.md (testing)
# - documentation-specialist.md (documentation)
# All run in parallel with isolated contexts
```

### Security & Validation
```bash
# Legacy (2024):
/validate-implementation --comprehensive

# Native (2025):
"Validate current implementation with security audit and testing"

# Result: Auto-delegates to:
# - security-auditor.md (LGPD compliance + security)
# - test-engineer.md (comprehensive testing)
# Both run in parallel
```

### Evidence Collection
```bash
# Legacy (2024):
/collect-evidence --all-viewports

# Native (2025):
"Collect comprehensive evidence for current implementation"

# Result: Auto-delegates to:
# - test-engineer.md (visual testing specialist)
# Executes multi-viewport screenshot automation
```

### Documentation Updates
```bash
# Legacy (2024):
/sync-documentation --delivery-mode

# Native (2025):
"Update all documentation with current implementation status"

# Result: Auto-delegates to:
# - documentation-specialist.md (CENTRAL-DE-CONTROLE management)
# Updates stakeholder dashboard automatically
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Legacy (2024):
# No equivalent command (manual process)

# Native (2025):
"Optimize WebAssembly bundle size and Phoenix performance"

# Result: Auto-delegates to:
# - performance-optimizer.md (bundle + database optimization)
# Target: 22.2MB â†’ <3MB bundle size
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Task Patterns

### Multi-Domain Analysis
```bash
# Native (2025):
"Analyze the Phoenix application for security, performance, and code quality"

# Result: Parallel execution:
# - security-auditor.md â†’ Security vulnerabilities + LGPD compliance
# - performance-optimizer.md â†’ Performance bottlenecks + optimization
# - test-engineer.md â†’ Code quality + test coverage analysis
# All agents work simultaneously with separate contexts
```

### Complete Feature Implementation
```bash
# Native (2025):
"Implement wizard step 1 with comprehensive testing and documentation"

# Result: Sequential + Parallel:
# 1. bm-wizard-specialist.md â†’ Implement wizard step
# 2. Parallel validation:
#    - test-engineer.md â†’ Test implementation
#    - security-auditor.md â†’ Security review
#    - documentation-specialist.md â†’ Update docs
```

### Complex Workflow
```bash
# Native (2025):
"Complete Phase BM-2 with security audit, testing, and delivery documentation"

# Result: Full pipeline with auto-coordination:
# 1. Implementation: bm-wizard-specialist.md
# 2. Parallel validation:
#    - security-auditor.md â†’ Security audit
#    - test-engineer.md â†’ Comprehensive testing
#    - performance-optimizer.md â†’ Performance validation
# 3. Documentation: documentation-specialist.md â†’ Delivery report
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Task Tool Parameters
```typescript
// How Claude internally uses Task tool
Task({
  description: "Implement Phase BM-2 wizard with validation",
  subagent_type: "bm-wizard-specialist",
  prompt: `
    Implement the 5-step content wizard for Phase BM-2:
    1. File upload functionality
    2. Content validation
    3. Progress tracking
    4. Integration with auth system
    5. Multi-viewport responsive design

    Reference: docs/wiki/componentes-projeto-bm/content-wizard-5-etapas.md
    Target: lib/blog_web/live/wizard/
  `
})
```

### Parallel Execution Example
```typescript
// Multiple agents running simultaneously
Promise.all([
  Task({
    description: "Security audit of wizard implementation",
    subagent_type: "security-auditor",
    prompt: "Audit wizard for LGPD compliance and security vulnerabilities"
  }),
  Task({
    description: "Test wizard functionality",
    subagent_type: "test-engineer",
    prompt: "Create comprehensive test suite and visual evidence"
  }),
  Task({
    description: "Update documentation",
    subagent_type: "documentation-specialist",
    prompt: "Update CENTRAL-DE-CONTROLE.md with wizard implementation"
  })
])
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance Improvements

### Development Velocity
```yaml
Legacy_Sequential:
  wizard_implementation: "45 minutes"
  security_audit: "30 minutes"
  testing: "20 minutes"
  documentation: "25 minutes"
  total_time: "120 minutes (2 hours)"

Native_Parallel:
  wizard_implementation: "45 minutes"
  parallel_validation: "30 minutes" # All run simultaneously
  total_time: "75 minutes (1.25 hours)"
  improvement: "37.5% faster"
```

### Context Efficiency
```yaml
Legacy_Shared_Context:
  context_pollution: "High"
  token_efficiency: "Low"
  cross_domain_confusion: "Frequent"

Native_Isolated_Contexts:
  context_pollution: "Zero (isolated per agent)"
  token_efficiency: "300% improvement"
  cross_domain_confusion: "Eliminated"
  total_context_capacity: "5x200k = 1M tokens available"
```

# â†’ test-engineer.md (testing)
# â†’ security-auditor.md (security)
# â†’ documentation-specialist.md (docs)
# â†’ performance-optimizer.md (optimization)

# Validation:
# - Multiple agents invoked
# - Parallel execution confirmed
# - All deliverables completed
# - 90.2% performance improvement achieved
```

### Test Case 3: Performance Task

# Expected delegation:
# â†’ performance-optimizer.md (bundle optimization specialist)

# Validation:
# - Correct specialist selected
# - Bundle analysis executed
# - Optimization recommendations provided
# - Target <3MB bundle size addressed
```

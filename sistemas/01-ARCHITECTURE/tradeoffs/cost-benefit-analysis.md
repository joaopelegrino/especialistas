## IX. BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

### Customer Acquisition Threshold

```yaml
break_even_customers:
  monthly_recurring_revenue: $208/customer (annual $2,500 / 12)
  monthly_costs: $478K (Year 1 average)

  break_even_customers: $478K / $208 = 2,298 customers

timeline:
  month_1_10: 100 customers/month (beta, word-of-mouth)
  month_11_12: 500 customers/month (paid marketing)

  cumulative:
    month_10: 1,000 customers
    month_12: 2,000 customers
    month_13: 2,500 customers ✅ BREAK-EVEN ACHIEVED

verdict: "Break-even in 13 months (Q2 2026)"
```

---

### Unit Economics

```yaml
customer_lifetime_value:
  annual_subscription: $2,500
  average_retention: 3 years
  gross_margin: 54% (Elixir stack)
  cltv: $2,500 × 3 years × 54% = $4,050

customer_acquisition_cost:
  marketing_spend: $200K/year (Year 2+)
  sales_team: 2 × $80K = $160K
  total_cac_spend: $360K/year

  new_customers_year2: 1,000
  cac: $360K / 1,000 = $360

ltv_cac_ratio: $4,050 / $360 = 11.25x

benchmark:
  healthy_saas_ratio: >3x
  world_class_ratio: >5x
  our_ratio: 11.25x ✅ EXCELLENT

verdict: "Unit economics are extremely healthy"

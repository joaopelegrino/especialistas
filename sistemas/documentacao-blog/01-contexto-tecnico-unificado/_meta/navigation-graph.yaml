# Usage Instructions

This navigation graph can be:
1. **Manually consulted** by developers for guided learning
2. **Programmatically parsed** by LLMs for context-aware suggestions
3. **Integrated into docs site** for interactive navigation
4. **Used by CI/CD** to validate doc coverage and linkage

# Next Steps

- [ ] Implement dynamic recommendation engine
- [ ] Create interactive docs site using this graph
- [ ] Add completion tracking per user
- [ ] Generate personalized learning paths
- [ ] Integrate with search functionality

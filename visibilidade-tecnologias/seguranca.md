(00:00) cyber security is one of the hottest jobs right now but the problem is everyone wants experience but no one tells you how to really get experience without having a job first and the common advice just do projects bro but here's the issue beginners end up doing random things without any relevant to the industry and they call them projects saying that you build up a seam in your resume is good but if you don't know what to do with the seam once you built it then you haven't actually learned anything that's relevant to the industry
(00:30) you just been looking at a box with green lights on this is not project and most importantly this is not experience that's why in this video I'm going to show you cyber security projects that will actually make you stand out the projects aren't random they fall under the five major cyber security areas that are the most in demand in the market right now but more importantly I will show you how to add them to your resume so make sure you pay attention to this video because it's very important for your journey as you trying to land your
(01:01) first cyber security job and progress in your cyber security career the video is broken down into five parts that represent the five major cyber security areas that are in demand in the market starting with the one that most of you are familiar with which is part one sock analyst projects I want you to acquire and practice your blue teaming and Security operation Center analyst skills for two very important reasons one because stock analyst jobs are just so high in demand there is simply more sock analyst jobs than any other cyber
(01:34) security specialization but two is to make you more of a cyber security generalist where you will be performing more than one tasks and one of the tasks that you will most definitely be performing is analyzing and responding to cyber security attacks this is very common in small to mediumsized organizations and for that we have three major platforms that I want you to practice with in no particular order let's defend try hack me and cyber Defenders both let's defend and tryck me have a livestock environment this is
(02:06) basically a real world life Security operation Center where you can look at incidents investigate them assign them to yourself and respond to them exactly like we do in the real world now as you learn in practice not every cyber security incident turns out to be a Cyber attack therefore it's your duty as a cyber security analyst to perform that triage and Analysis to perform whether it's a real C attack or it's a false positive or a user error now let me show you what the let's defense Security operation Center looks like as you can
(02:38) see it looks exactly like a real world Security operation center now trust me this is the kind of stuff that you will be asked about in interviews so having that Hands-On practice will help you immensely in passing interviews now cyber Defenders has a slightly different approach they have what they refer to as blue team Labs now this is different than their popular certification certified cyber Defender CCD which by the way is a fantastic certification if you want me to do a deep dive in cyber Defender CCD or into the new try hack
(03:11) meod let me know in the comment below and I'll make time for it now looking at Cyber Defenders lab they are basically three levels ranging from beginner all the way to some really challenging and advanced Labs now looking at their Labs it's pretty comprehensive as you can see and it goes really deep into incident response and digital forensics so if digital forensic and incidental response which is short for DFI is something you're interested in then cyber Defenders is definitely a great platform for that I'll leave a link to all these
(03:40) labs in the description box below but the question is do you really need to do all of those labs and my honest answer is you should continue to learn up until you landar your first cyber security job because this is the real stuff that you perform in your cyber security job so if you don't have experience the way we add this to the resume which we will get too shortly is precisely to compensate for lack of experience now once you land your first cyber security job it's your choice you can choose to continue to
(04:09) learn and progress in your career or you can do what the majority of people do which is nothing most people in cyber security they don't learn and they don't progress in their career one is not better than the other it's your choice it's your life I personally chose to continue to learn and progress whil my colleagues were pretty happy with the job they got and they are just cruising there are pros and cons to each approach one is not better than the other you're an adult and you need to make your own choices now in this video I'm giving you
(04:37) a lot of options pick the one that resonate more with you and work your way through the others you don't really need to do them in order and if you find that some of these labs are difficult the Assumption here is that you followed some of my road maps where I recommend Hands-On practical certifications such as hack the box cdsa or cyber Defender CCD or Blue Team level one and level two and try hack me so if you you find that the labs are a bit too hot perhaps go and do a proper Hands-On certifications then come back to these Labs however
(05:07) most of you will be able to just follow through and do these Labs even without doing these certifications it's not what I recommend but it's possible now I'm going to show you how to add it to your rume but first go to Unix guide.com sfree to download this free cyber security resumé template that I will be using throughout this video to add each live to the resume so as I will show you here we will have a section called practical projects and under this section the first project I will add is the practice with let's defend so we
(05:36) will say Liv sock monitoring let's defend monitored realtime security alerts perform triage and investigated incident in a simulated sock environment it's nice and brief you can choose to add more detail depending on how big your resume is we try to keep it to one maximum 1 and A2 Pages especially if you're an absolute beginner and if you practice with tryhackme and cyber defense this is how I would add them to the resume so as you can see one paragraph for tryck me and one paragraph for cyber Defenders now especially with
(06:09) something like cyber Defenders where there are so many labs and different tools that you practice with you can make the experience specific to that particular tool you practiced with there is no right or wrong answer on how to frame it in your resume but I choose to make it a little bit broad but you still have the choice to be more specific into a certain tool that you've used or a certain lab that you've practiced with but now that you've managed to practice your blue teaming skills in a security Operation Center environment the next
(06:37) step is to go a little bit deeper in one of the most important areas in your journey as a cyber security analyst which is part two of this video Network traffic analysis and active directory and for this we will use one of my favorite platforms hack the box as I mentioned earlier they have a certification called cdsa which I reviewed in the past in this video you can check it out in your own time but these Labs that I'm going to show you are from hack the Box Academy it's a little bit confusing their platform have
(07:07) hack the box which is certifications and then they have their Academy which is Capture the Flag style labs and learning environment so here we're using hack the Box Academy now the true strength of hack the Box platform is that they approach things from the hacker point of view so they really take an offensive security to learning which makes the labs a little bit more challenging than what some of you are using to this is the common complaint that I hear about hack the books yes it's hard but that's how we learn this is a feature it's not
(07:37) a bug don't run away from hard things especially when those things are actual skills that we use on the job so from hack the Box Academy we will be doing three Labs the first one is called introduction to network traffic analysis now analyzing Network traffic to determine what good traffic looks like versus what malicious traffic looks like it's precisely what we do as cyber security analysts when we protect organizations now some of you will be familiar with the material here but I still think it's an excellent review for
(08:08) you because this is one of the fundamental skills that you need but for some of you this might be new information especially if you've learned from say multiple choice type exams this will give you a chance to have a deeper look at what network traffic actually looks like so don't sleep on this and the next Lab is an introduction to active directory if you have plans to work in cyber security then and you will most definitely run into active directory it's something used in the industry worldwide so you definitely
(08:36) need to understand active directory now I'm not saying that you need to become an active directory administrator however the bare minimum knowledge that you need to be a good cyber security professional is to cover the information in this introductory module and the final one is Windows event logs and finding evil this is where we will look into Windows servers logs to determine what malicious traffic looks like like this lab is a little bit more challenging than the previous two but as I said challenging and hard is good this
(09:07) is how you learn so buckle up because this is all extremely important information and as I said earlier there will be links to everything in the description box below but now that we've covered everything when it comes to Security operation centers and responding and analyzing cyber attacks the next crucial step is something that's highly in demand in the market which you will most certainly run to which is part three of this video vulnerability management but before we continue I want to thank the sponsor of
(09:36) this video who has given us a generous 20% discount not pass business did you know that the average number of passwords used for business related accounts is 87 which is insane but you can manage all of that with not pass business which is an intuitive password manager for business and individuals which is ideal for productivity not only that but a huge security risk that businesses face is off boarding users once they lift the business this is a big challenge for identity and access management in fact research have shown
(10:10) that one in four people can still log to their accounts from previous jobs they've left granting them access to information that they shouldn't have access to again huge security risk but with not pass business you can manage user access efficiently which allows you to streamline onboarding and offboarding users and managing user account credentials you can also track your organization corporate data under a single pan of glass this is a huge thing for managing identity and access which is a big headache for businesses and
(10:43) research have also shown that on average it takes 121 days for a business to identify data breaches which is insane but with the data breach notification feature with not pass business you can change any password that was compromised before any damage is done try it out today use Unix guy coupon code at northp pass.
(11:09) com Unix guy to get not pass business with 20% off the coupon applies to all new business plans and back to the video If you followed my six month cyber security road map you would have done the free quales vulnerability Management training now quales is one of two major vulnerability management platforms that we use in the industry the second one is table both both platforms work in exactly the same way so if you learn qualus it will be really easy to use tenable in this project we will be practicing with tenable vulnerability management platform my
(11:41) friend Josh who is an experienced cyber security professional built this excellent cyber range where it will give you Hands-On practice with tenable which was really hard to get because you actually need to pay a commercial license to be even able to touch tenable so looking at the Cyber range it first starts off with videos that will explain explain to you how to use tenable the videos consist of lecture that cover a broad range of topics and then within the Cyber range you'll be able to create a user on Microsoft Azure Cloud
(12:10) environment and in this Azure environment you'll get to see live Windows servers that get attacked so as part of your Learning Journey you'll be able to scan those servers using tenable and produce a vulnerability management report and you get to respond and remediate those vulnerabilities in exactly the same way that we do it in a professional environment which makes this an extremely valuable resource trust me I didn't have access to all of these resources when I was starting out it would have made my life so much
(12:39) easier so take advantage of everything that's available to you in the Cyber range you'll also get to practice with threat hunting scenarios perform Security operation tasks and perform live incident response on real cyber security attacks this is how we will add it to our resume notice that we use log in Pacific cyber range because that's the name of Josh's company but what I didn't mention is even within that cyber range there is an option to do an internship in Josh's company so go check out that cyber range and take advantage
(13:13) of this excellent opportunity but the biggest mistake that people make when they try to break into cyber security is that they assume that cyber security is just offensive security hacking and Security operation Center what most people don't know is that a huge part of cyber security is not even technical which is what we collectively refer to as governance risk and compliance which is part four of this video GC this is the part of cyber security where you won't be configuring tools and you will not be responding to cyber security
(13:45) attacks and you won't even be performing ethical hacking so what is it that you would do good question quite a lot you will essentially be performing risk assessments going over documentation produce a lot of reports reviewing a lot of documents and if you're senior enough you may be presenting technical findings to non-technical audience which is typically Senior Management and in some cases it could be the CIO the CEO or even the board of directors now this is especially important for those of you who actually want to progress into your
(14:17) career and become a manager or head of cyber security or even Chief information security officers those extremely senior roles are not really technical they are GRC roles with a bit of people management M hiring strategy and a lot of communication and a lot of influencing senior leaders now because GC is nuance and it requires you to have exposure to so many areas and it requires true seniority I created GC Mastery for you to summarize what the market is actually looking for now this is not a class where I will look at a
(14:52) PDF and I read a PDF for you and it's definitely not a lowquality rehash of some com material this is based on true experience in the field advising massive organizations on their cyber security problems now what I want to show you here is how to list projects from GC Mastery into your resume if you've done GC Mastery we have a practical assessment at the end of each module but also at the end of the training course we have an endtoend Capstone project where you perform an assessment on an entire organization now you could list
(15:24) every practical assessment as its own project but that's not what I recommend instead I want you to be strategic and pick and choose projects that match your target Organization for example if the organization requires you to have skills in thirdparty Risk Management in GRC Mastery we have an entire module covering this topic and the Practical assessment actually gets you to perform third party risk assessment on a supplier and present those findings therefore this is how you can add that as a line item into your resume so you
(15:55) can say conducted third party risk assessment on a supplier as part of cyber security GRC Mastery training course the assessment consisted of reviewing a third party security assessment questionnaire assessing and summarizing the key risk identified another example could be adding a project for Asset Management which is again covered by an entire module in GC Mastery this is how I want you to add it to your resume we basically say Asset Management design the process to capture assets and maintain a cmdb as part of
(16:26) cyber security GC Mastery training course as you can see we list the skill we said that we perform the skill and then you say as part of cyber security GRC Mastery training course this is how you can add as many projects as you can because GC Mastery is fully practical so it's essentially like a group of many projects thrown at you with a lot of information but finally what you really need to have in your resume as part of GRC Mastery is the Capstone project because it's extremely comprehensive and it's actually a senior task that usually
(16:58) requires a lot of know so it's important to Showcase that you've done it in your resume this is how I would add it I say conducted an endtoend cyber security maturity assessment using the N CSF framework as part of cyber security GRC Mastery training course now apart from GRC Mastery do you need more projects within GC now contrary to the advice that I see on the internet the answer is no you don't because GC is not like the technical disciplines where you need to create a portfolio it doesn't actually work that way GC knowledges essentially
(17:33) how to perform risk assessment conduct maturity assessment review compliance documents once you learn that methodology that process there isn't much to learn in terms of GC itself instead you need to be working on your technical skills let me give you an example let's say you're conducting a risk assessment on a software application that lives in Amazon AWS Cloud the GRC knowledge part of this is how to follow a questionnaire how to assess the risk and how to present the findings this is the easy part the difficult part is actually understanding
(18:06) the underlying technology of Amazon AWS and the application this will be your limitation yes GC is non-technical in the sense you are not the person who will create the application or configure the cloud but you need to know how things work in GC master I give you so much information on what to look for when you conduct these assessments however you still need to continue and grow your technical skills do not waste your time on nonsense endless GC practice because that's not going to teach you anything instead do GC Mastery
(18:40) then move on to technical disciplines and speaking of technical disciplines the next one that we will cover is one you will most definitely see in the real world which is part five of this video Cloud security there is 100% chance that you will work for an organization that uses the cloud in one way shape or form therefore understanding the cloud isn't non-negotiable I have this video right here where I teach you how to become a cloud security engineer you can do some of the trainings in this video or you can do all of them you can pick and
(19:11) choose but in this video I'm going to show you how to add Cloud security projects to your resume in the description box of this video I've linked a number of cloud security projects that I want you to go over I'm not going to Showcase every single project here just to make this video brief but I will show you how to add them to to your resume so for example let's look at this project titled utilizing I am to manage permissions for S3 I am stands for identity and access management and S3 is the S3 storage buckets in Amazon AWS so under the
(19:44) project section I want you to write utilized I am to manage permissions for S3 bucket on Amazon AWS the project consisted of creating a user creating an AM policy to allow the user access to S3 and accessing the S3 bucket and objects as the same user with the attached policy so if we read the project what I did is I took the title of the project and the description and I added it into one line item so I used the title of the project then I said the project consisted of and then I added the project description you can simply do
(20:18) that for all the cloud projects listed in the description box of this video but now that you've managed to do cyber security training and cyber security projects and you have a killer resume but you're wondering how do I even start applying to cyber security jobs especially ones that are asking for years of experience then I've got you covered this video right here will show you in a step by-step manner how to search for and apply to entry-level cyber security job and it even includes information about cover letters and a
(20:49) free cover letter template check it out and I'll see you there
